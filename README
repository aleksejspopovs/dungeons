Welcome to dungeons project page!

Dungeons is a 2d roguelike game (or maybe even a game engine) using HTML5 <canvas> & JavaScript.
Even though it's current features are kind of limited, I'm going to make great efforts in developing it further.
Right now, it's future is quite uncertain. Here are some thoughts on what it might become:
1. a simple roguelike game
2. a fully-fledged RPG with a storyline
3. a 2d MMO :3

Dungeons is free software, provided under the MIT license (more info in LICENSE file). I would be really happy to see other developers pick up dungeons and make some cool things with it.

Thank you for taking your time to read this.
Alexey "popoffka"/"mariofag" Popov,
the developer of dungeons
