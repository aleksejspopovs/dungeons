Because of not having walked any distance farther than
your chair to the toilet, your legs have atrophied and
you are unable to walk diagonally. Everyone else in the
world notices this and to humor you, they also only walk 
in 4 directions. But believe me, when you're not there, 
they walk any way they want while whispering about how 
awkward you are. 

Never forget it.
